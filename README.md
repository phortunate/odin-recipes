HTML - The Odin Project
Creating a simple recipe website using only HTML.

Once complete I will have demonstrated the following skills.
 - Creating the base boiler-plate html to load a webpage.
 - Using ordered and unordered lists.
 - Linking to and from various webpages that I've created.
 - Embedding images to those webpages.
 - Geting more comfortable with basic Git commands (status, log, add, commit, and push)
